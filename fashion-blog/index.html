        <p>Always be true to your own sense of style, if you dont youll be uncomfortable the whole time and it will
            show. Remember, NYFW is about expressing yourself and taking in what the designers have chosen to express
            through their new lines. Also its important to wear shoes youll be comfortable in all day. Obviously you
            want to look good, but youll be on your feet all day long, so be prepared.</p>
